The Number Plate Recognition with Parallelized Training project showcases an advanced approach to automatic license plate recognition (ANPR) using machine learning. This implementation aims at recognizing vehicle number plates efficiently while putting the power of distributed learning to use.<br>
TensorFlow: This library is the backbone of the parallelized training process, facilitating distribution across multiple resources, which in my case are multiple GPU cores.<br>
OpenCV: For image processing tasks to enhance the accuracy of plate detection.<br>
Jupyter Notebook: This project utilizes Google Colab, allowing for an interactive coding environment that is very desirable for both development and demonstration purposes.
